# blueprint-service-archetype
The archetype is a skeleton which based on the Spring Boot and contains all required dependencies and example classes
from REST controller through a service to persistent layer.

It contains an example API document which is generated by Asciidoc Plugin.

Additionally, there is pre-configured MapStruct dependency, which allows us to easily map objects.

In order to simplify an error handling on REST, the Zalando dependencies have been integrated.

The easiest way to use the archetype is to check it out, install with the local maven and generate a project from installed archetype.
It can be achieved by performing following steps:

1. Checkout the project from github:
```
git clone https://github.com/rafal-slowik/blueprint-service-archetype.git
```
2. Go to the main directory of the project and install the archetype: 
```
mvn -B -U clean install
```
3. Generate a project from installed archetype:

```
mvn archetype:generate \
-DarchetypeGroupId=com.slowikit.blueprint \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=blueprint-service-archetype \
-DarchetypeVersion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
-DgroupId=com.slowikit \
-DartifactId=myservice \
-Dversion=0.0.1-SNAPSHOT \
-Dpackage=com.slowikit.myservice
```

The properties ***DgroupId, DartifactId, Dversion, Dpackage*** can be freely adjusted to the needs of the project.
